# Implementation of KNN algorithm from scratch

###### Srinivas_Ashwin_PS3.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file
###### housing.csv - Housing price dataset

This project contains the implementation of KNN algorithm from scratch without the use of any external python libraries to predict the mean housing price for homes in Boston


Step 1 - Descriptive Analysis (EDA)

Step 2 - Code RMSE Function

Step 3 - Manually divide data into train & Test

Step 4 - Calculate RMSE

Step 5 - Code nearest neighbor function

Step 6 - Implement Nearest Neighbor algorithm

Step 7 - Normalize data

Step 8 - Manual Cross-Validation (code k-fold cross validation from scratch)

Step 9 - Optimize and find best values for "k"
